2025-07-28T14:16:57.3295350Z To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.4/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
2025-07-28T14:16:58.3283949Z Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build 
2025-07-28T14:17:04.7313246Z This version only understands SDK XML versions up to 3 but an SDK XML file of version 4 was encountered. This can happen if you use versions of Android Studio and the command-line tools that were released at different times.
